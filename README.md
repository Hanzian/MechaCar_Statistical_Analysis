# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview of Project
A few weeks after starting his new role, Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

In this challenge, you’ll help Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:

* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.


## Deliverables:
This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a proposal for further statistical study. You’ll submit the following:

* Data Source: `MechaCar_mpg.csv` and `Suspension_Coil.csv`
* Data Tools:  `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2` and `MechaCarChallenge.RScript`.
* Software: `RStudio` and `R`

# Deliverable 1:  
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### Deliverable Requirements:

The `MechaCar_mpg.csv` dataset contains mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics, such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance, were collected for each vehicle. Using your knowledge of R, you’ll design a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from the `MechaCar_mpg.csv file`. 

> To Deliver. 

- The `MechaCar_mpg.csv` file is imported and read into a dataframe
- An RScript is written for a linear regression model to be performed on all six variables
- An RScript is written to create the statistical summary of the linear regression model with the intended p-values
- There is a summary that addresses all three questions


#### Results on Deliverable:
**Resulting Model:** 

### mpg =  (6.267)**vehicle_length** + (0.0012)**vehicle_weight** + (0.0688)**spoiler_angle** + (3.546)**ground_clearance** + (-3.411)**AWD** + (-104.0)
				

**Statistical Summary:**

From the above output we can see that:

1. The **vehicle length**, and **vehicle ground clearance** are statistically likely to provide non-random amounts of variance to the model. That is to say, the vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance have a significant impact on miles per gallon on the MechaCar prototype. Conversely,
the **vehicle weight**, **spoiler angle**, and **All Wheel Drive** (AWD) have p-Values that indicate a random amount of variance with the dataset.  

2. The p-Value for this model, ```p-Value: 5.35e-11```, is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. This indicates there is sufficient evidence to **reject our null hypothesis**, which further indcates that the slope of this linear model is **not zero**.


3.  This linear model has an r-squared value of 0.7149, which means that approximately 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model. Relatively speaking, his multiple regression model **does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively**. 

If we remove the less impactful independent variables (vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and All Wheel Drive), the predictability does decrease, but not drastically: the r-squared value falls from 0.7149 to 0.674.
